# django-filebase

not the last django filemanager you'll ever need. reduced and usable, though.


## Goals

todo: finalize these!

- do less, but do less on a high level.
- no, or at least only very few, external dependencies
- provide a filebrowser that is usable for file AND image selection (thumbnail browser)
